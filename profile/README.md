# 🤔 ~What is Synt?~ ( Synt outdated, check out Synt+ )
Synt is a programming language and it is very suitable for beginners. Code is easy and really simple. Syntax is user friendly are really readable for person who can read and understand English.

Synt is free and open source. It is made with Python. Synt is the next gen programming language. It is made so that updates are easy and fast. Synt is made to make software and game development easier and faster.

For the history of Synt, it was initiated by Attachment Aditya in year 2020. It was initially expected to be worked for about 1-2 Months. Later as time went by, it was expanded to be a larger project. It will most probably be getting updated and expanded in the future.

# ✨ Synt+ is here!

> Synt+ is a large project and releasing all at once is very hard and will take a very long time, hence it will be released in chunks and will be updated to include more features in the future.

Synt(Plus) is the continuation of Synt - Programming Language - Made for beginners and Plus for beginners and professionals.

Synt+ is designed to be very easy for new-comers to the programming world, yet powerful enough to create the future with the help of developer’s ideas. It’s made to become a true programming language alternative.

It’s way better than an esoteric language. It’s not for a specific purpose, not a set of random commands with no logics, not complicated and definitely not as a joke. It’s made for everyone.

Development started - early 2023
